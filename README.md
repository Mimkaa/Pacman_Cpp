## PacMan in C++
### wont lie at first after python coding in c++  was a pure suffering but in 3 days or so of getting used to it I kinda starter enjoing coding with it.

# Features:
- A* pathfinding;
- Pacman and ghost are dynamically generated(they are not just cut of frames from a  spritesheet)
        
# Instances:
![This is a alt text.](/examples/sample1.png "This is a sample image.")
![This is a alt text.](/examples/sample2.png "This is a sample image.")
![This is a alt text.](/examples/sample3.png "This is a sample image.")
